<br />
We love to purchase books. Our buyer is available by appointment. Please call ahead and arrange a time before coming down.
<br /><br />
All books are purchased on an as needed basis. We hate to have anyone come down on a wasted trip but we just can’t tell if we are going to need the book without seeing it first.
<br /><br />
If you need to sell your entire collection and we are not able to pick through please let us know in advance.
<br /><br />
All purchases over $5.00 will be paid for by company check.
<br /><br />

This is not an all inclusive list. Please feel free to bring any book in your collection. Most times it’s the titles you never thought would sell are the first ones we grab.
<br /><br />
Fiction however, especially hard cover fiction is our most restrictive section as far as buying goes. It’s not that we don’t buy fiction but because of the sheer volume out there we are very selective.
