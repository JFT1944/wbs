<br />
<b>We accept books to be used for trade credit. Trading books (as opposed to buying) is predominantly done with mass market paperbacks but not  exclusively. Trade-ins can be done any time we are open and can be handled by any employee.
<br /><br />

</p>
<br />
<ul id='liOption' style='width: 90vw;'>
<li>All books properly stamped from us will receive the stated amount of credit noted in the stamp. Usually half the purchase price.</li>
<br />

<li>All other books will receive credit of 5 cents to a five dollars ($5) based on age, condition, & subject matter.</li>

<br />

<li>A book purchased from us is ONLY eligible for trade credit if the book is stamped inside and clearly shows what you are paying and what your trade credit will be.</li>
<br />
<li>Books in which prices are penciled or written upon a sticker (usually Trade paperbacks or hard covers) do not share this privilege.</li>
<br />
<li>This is not to say we don’t take them back. However the eligibility varies with the condition and the amount we have in stock.</li>

<br />
<li>Mass market paperbacks with a copyright date of the past 3 to 4 months will receive the preferential treatment as if they were purchased from us whether they were or not.</li>
<br />

<li>Trade credits assessed are for like items. (i.e. Paperback for paperbacks, hardcover for hard covers etc.)</li>
<br />

<li>If the amount of your purchases does not exceed the amount of trade credit by 20% then 20% of the sale must be in cash. Leftover credit is issued to you in the form of a credit voucher good for one year.</li>
<br />

<li>We reserve the right to refuse any book (even our own)</li>
<br />

<li>Trade credit can't be used for Special Orders, or books on hold</li>
<br />
</ul>
