<b>We do purchase comics for our back issue stock. Due to our price structure, however, we can not pay collectors prices. For that reason all we can pay for comics is ten cents apiece.</b>
<br /><br />
<b>If you feel that you need collectors' prices for your books see our <a href='/links'>Links</a> page for another dealer.</b>

<b>Comics are purchased during the same hours as books: Wednesday through Saturday 11:00 am till 5:00 pm </b>
<br /><br />
<b>Please call or <a href='mailto:'>e-mail</a> to set up an appointment for larger collections.</b>
