<b>We do purchase comics for our back issue stock. Due to our price structure, however, we can not pay collectors prices. For that reason all we can pay for comics is ten cents apiece.</b>
 <b>If you feel that you need collectors' prices for your books see our <a href='/link'>Links</a> page for another dealer.</b>
 <b>Comics are purchased during the same hours as books: Wednesday through Saturday 11:00 am till 5:00 pm </b>
 <b>Please call or <a mce_href="mailto:">e-mail</a> to set up an appointment for larger collections.</b>

We love to purchase books. Our buyer is available by appointment. Please call ahead and arrange a time before coming down.
<br /><br />
All books are purchased on an as needed basis. We hate to have anyone come down on a wasted trip but we just can’t tell if we are going to need the book without seeing it first.
<br /><br />
If you need to sell your entire collection and we are not able to pick through please let us know in advance.
<br /><br />
All purchases over $5.00 will be paid for by company check.
<br /><br />
We are always buying a wide range of subject matter however we are especially seeking:
<br /><br />
<ul>	
<li>Fine Binding Editions (Easton Press, Franklin Mint etc.)</li>
<li>Metaphysics</li>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Critical Theology</li>

<br /><br />	
This is not an all inclusive list. Please feel free to bring any book in your collection. Most times it’s the titles you never thought would sell are the first ones we grab.
<br /><br />
Fiction however, especially hard cover fiction is our most restrictive section as far as buying goes. It’s not that we don’t buy fiction but because of the sheer volume out there we are very selective.







Trade Credit Policy

	
We accept books to be used for trade credit. Trading books (as opposed to buying) is predominantly done with mass market paperbacks but not  exclusively. Trade-ins can be done any time we are open and can be handled by any employee.

On any given day we take in literally hundreds of paperbacks in trade. Over the past 40 years we have honed a Trade Credit Policy which we feel balances a fair market value to the customer all the while not giving away the farm.

To avoid disappointment a Trade Credit with us should be thought of as a savings coupon not as a way to get out without paying anything.

	
All books properly stamped from us will receive the stated amount of credit noted in the stamp. Usually half the purchase price.


All other books will receive credit of 5 cents to a dollar based on age, condition, & subject matter.


A book purchased from us is ONLY eligible for trade credit if the book is stamped inside and clearly shows what you are paying and what your trade credit will be.

Books in which prices are penciled or written upon a sticker (usually Trade paperbacks or hard covers) do not share this privilege.

This is not to say we don’t take them back. However the eligibility varies with the condition and the amount we have in stock. If you purchase these types of books with us for the express purpose of trading them back in you may wish to rethink your purchase of these items.


Mass market paperbacks with a copyright date of the past 3 to 4 months will receive the preferential treatment as if they were purchased from us whether they were or not. (This is the BEST deal in town)


Trade credits assessed are for like items. (i.e. Paperback for paperbacks, hardcover for hard covers etc.)


If the amount of your purchases does not exceed the amount of trade credit by 20% then 20% of the sale must be in cash. Leftover credit is issued to you in the form of a credit voucher good for one year.


We reserve the right to refuse any book (even our own)


Trade credit can't be used for Special Orders, or books on hold


Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions
